## What We Look For In A Candidate

  1. Knowledge of Ruby on Rails.
  2. Familiarity with Javascript.
  2. Can work with technologies (i.e. Angular) that you may not have seen before.
  3. Can work independently and troubleshoot issues with **minimal requirements and guidance**.

#### Step 1: Build a Ruby on Rails application that serves the provided Angular App (see /index.html)

  When you visit `http://localhost:3000/` you should see the Angular app!

  1. `GET /tacos` - Returns a list of all tacos in the database
  2. `POST /tacos` - Creates a taco with the given parameters
  3. `DELETE /tacos/:id` - Removes the taco with this ID from the database

#### Step 3: Upload your completed solution to a public [Github](https://www.heroku.com/) repository so we can review.

#### Step 4: Host the working solution on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and send the Heroku App URL to us for review.
